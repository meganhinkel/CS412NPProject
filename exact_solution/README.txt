To run the the shell script that executes my program on all test cases, enter the 
command "./run_test_cases.sh" when in the exact_solution folder. 

For each test, it will output whether the test has passed or not, and a time of 
how long it took for the test to run. 

If you wish to check the expected outputs for each input, look in the outputs folder
which is located inside the test_cases folder!
